You are working in this repository to implement a Python compiler in TypeScript.
Your goal is to make `scripts/verify.sh` pass.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT modify any existing files under `tests/`, `examples/`, or `scripts/`.
- Do not rely on third-party compiler/transpiler libraries; implement compiler stages yourself.
- Do not use shell commands to bypass the compiler implementation tasks.
- Keep changes focused and minimal; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Prefer TypeScript changes in `src/` as needed.
- If you add new files, keep them small and well-scoped.

Process:
- Inspect failures and determine the minimal fix.
- If tests fail, use the error output to guide changes.
- Provide a concise explanation of what you changed and why.
- At the end of the task, use the persistent-notes skill to record durable project notes in `notes/iterations`.
